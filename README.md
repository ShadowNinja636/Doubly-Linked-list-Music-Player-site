# Linked-list-Music-Player-site


## Overview
This project is a simple web-based music player built to demonstrate the practical application of a fundamental data structure: the doubly linked list. The player features basic playback controls (play, pause, next, previous) and a dynamic playlist UI, all powered by a custom linked list implementation in JavaScript. This project also helped me practice JavaScript.

## Key Learnings & Features
Data Structures: I implemented a DoublyLinkedList class from scratch, including Node objects for each song. This showcases a strong understanding of how to manage and manipulate data in a non-linear fashion.

1. Algorithms: The playback controls navigate the linked list, demonstrating my ability to build basic algorithms for traversing a data structure.

2. Front-End Development: The project uses HTML for structure and CSS for styling, creating a clean and modern user interface.

3. Event Handling: I used JavaScript event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicking the play/pause or navigation buttons.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML: For the page structure and audio element.

2. CSS: For styling the player and controls.

3. JavaScript: For implementing the linked list, handling user interaction, and managing the music playback logic.

## How to Run
To run this project, place the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files in a single directory. Make sure to also create an audio folder in the same directory containing your music files. Then, simply open index.html in any web browser.

## Future Improvements
Dynamic Playlist: Instead of hardcoding the playlist, the player could load songs from a backend API or a JSON file.

Progress Bar: A progress bar could be added to visualize the current song's playback and allow the user to seek to different parts of the track.

Volume Control: A slider or button could be implemented to give the user control over the audio volume.
